# Star Arm 102 leader plugin — release-compatible generation

[← LeRobot](../README.md)

This package registers `lerobot_teleoperator_stararm102` with `Motor_0.pos` through `Motor_5.pos` and `gripper.pos`. Use the [LeRobot guide](../README.md) to install, calibrate, and teleoperate an LD/FL pair.

For development, from the repository root in the release-compatible environment:

```bash
python -m pip install ./lerobot/lerobot-teleoperator-stararm102
```

The [refactored HD/FL package](../lerobot-stararm102/README.md) uses the same distribution/import name. Install it in a separate environment. The plugin in this directory does not provide that package's HD button configuration.

Reinstall after source edits. Default editable installs can be missed by LeRobot 0.4.1 plugin discovery.
