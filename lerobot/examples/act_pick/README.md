**Run a supplied policy before training your own.** This example uses a Star Arm 102-FL and two cameras to place a block in the center of a prepared workspace.

## What you need

- A Star Arm 102-FL with a secure base, its matching supply, and a USB data connection.
- Two RGB cameras: `up` (overhead) and `front` (frontal), each at **640 × 480, 30 FPS**.
- A workspace, block, placement target, and camera views matching the photographs below.
- Ubuntu 22.04, an NVIDIA GPU with a compatible driver for the saved CUDA configuration, and the release-compatible LeRobot environment described in [inference](inference.md).
- A leader is optional for autonomous inference; it is useful for manual demonstrations or resets after separate calibration.

Setup and calibration are required before motion. This is a task-specific demo, and a different block, camera position, lighting, or calibration can change the result. No measured success rate is published in this release.

## Model card

| Field | Released information |
| --- | --- |
| Policy | ACT, checkpoint at 100,000 training steps |
| Robot | Star Arm 102-FL, release-compatible 0.0.1 robot plugin |
| State / action | 7 position channels: `Motor_0`…`Motor_5`, `gripper` |
| Image inputs | `observation.images.up`, `observation.images.front` |
| Model archive | `stararm102_pick_act_torch271.tar.gz` |
| Integrity | [SHA256SUMS.txt](SHA256SUMS.txt) |
| Download location | GitHub release `act-pick-v1.0.0`; no Hugging Face model repository is required for this example |
| Training configuration | Included as `train_config.json`; training dataset and full environment lock are not supplied. See [training scope](training.md) |

Keep the weights, configuration, and processor files together. The refactored `stararm102_fl` plugin is **not** a drop-in replacement for this model.
