# Product overview and joint mapping

[Home](../README.md) · [Hardware setup](hardware-setup.md)

Star Arm 102 provides six arm joints and a gripper/handle channel. LD and HD are leaders; FL is the actuated follower. HD is the pose-holding leader, using high-torque RP8 coreless servos for stable demonstrations and extended data collection. Its button behavior depends on the software integration.

| Model | Role | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 102-LD | Leader for teleoperation | [Python](../python-sdk/README.md) or [release-compatible LeRobot](../lerobot/README.md) |
| 102-HD | Leader with button-board support | [Python](../python-sdk/README.md) or [refactored LeRobot](../lerobot/lerobot-stararm102/README.md) |
| 102-FL | Follower for teleoperation and policy execution | [ACT model](../lerobot/examples/act_pick/README.md) or [ROS 2](../ros2-humble/README.md) |

## Joint IDs and names

| Servo ID | Release-compatible LeRobot | Refactored LeRobot | ROS description |

Matching IDs do not mean matching units, signs, scaling, or calibration. See [plugin compatibility](compatibility.md). Do not transfer joint values between these interfaces without the appropriate conversion.

For product dimensions, payload, and the exact supplied configuration, use the official [LD](https://fashionstar.com.hk/store/product/star-arm-102-ld/), [HD](https://fashionstar.com.hk/store/product/star-arm-102-hd/), and [FL](https://fashionstar.com.hk/store/product/star-arm-102-fl/) specifications. The [LD engineering drawings](../hardware/102-ld/drawings/) provide mechanical reference files. Motion limits in a URDF or configuration describe that software model and are not a substitute for the limits of your hardware revision.
